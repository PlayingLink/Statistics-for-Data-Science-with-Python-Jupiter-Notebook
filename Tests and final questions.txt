1. Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not? (T-test for independent samples)

Hypothesis:
There is not a significant difference in the median value of the houses bounded by the Charles River

Test:
a = 0.05
P Value became 1.4651540072350996e^-305

Conclusion:
Because the P Value, 1.465154e^-305, is less than a, 0.05, the Null Hypothesis is ignored, so the there is a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River.

2. Is there a difference in Median values of houses (MEDV) for each proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 (AGE)? (ANOVA)

Hypothesis:
There is a difference in the Median Values of Houses for each Proportion of the owner-ocupied units built prior to 1940

Test:
a = 0.5
P Value became 

3. Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and proportion of non-retail business acres per town? (Pearson Correlation)



4. What is the impact of an additional weighted distance  to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes? (Regression analysis)
