1. Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River or not? (T-test for independent samples)

Hypothesis:
There is not a significant difference in the median value of the houses bounded by the Charles River

Test:
a = 0.05
P Value became 1.4651540072350996e^-305

Conclusion:
Because the P Value, 1.465154e^-305, is less than a, 0.05, the Null Hypothesis is ignored, so there is a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River.

2. Is there a difference in Median values of houses (MEDV) for each proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 (AGE)? (ANOVA)

Hypothesis:
There is a difference in the Median Values of Houses for each Proportion of the owner-ocupied units built prior to 1940

Test:
a = 0.05
P Value became 3.20946197250671e^-176

Conclusion:
Because the P Value, 3.209462e^-176, is less than a, 0.05, the Null Hypothesis is ignored, so there is a significant difference in Median Values of Houses for each Proportion of the owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

3. Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town? (Pearson Correlation)

Hypothesis:
Yes, there is no relationship between Nitric Oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town

Test:
a = 0.05
P Value became 7.913361061210442e^-98

Conclusion:
Because the P Value, 7.913361e^-98, is less than a, 0.05, the Null Hypothesis is ignored, so there is no relationship between Nitric Oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town

4. What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes? (Regression analysis)

Hypothesis: There won't be an impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes

Test:
a = 0.05
P Value became 0.00 for both the constant and "DIS"

Conclusion:
Because the P Value, 0.00, is smaller than a, 0.05, the Null Hypothesis is ignored, so there is no impact og an additional weighted distance to the Five Boston employment Centers on the Median Value of owner-occupied homes.
